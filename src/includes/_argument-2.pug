        mj-text Benefits of the Malta residency program
        mj-text In addition to being a fairly quick path to residency - just six to eight months for approval - there are many other benefits to this highly sought-after program:
        mj-text Residence in an EU country with visa-free access across Europe's Schengen Area for 90 days out of a 180-day period.
        mj-text The right to reside indefinitely in Malta (one of Europe's safest countries).
        mj-text Investment required for the first five years only (and only after you have secured approval).
        mj-text Family members can be included.
        mj-text No residence requirement to maintain your permanent residence status.
        mj-text English is the official language - and there is no language test.
        mj-text Once you receive approval, your permanent residency card is issued with a five-year validity (and easily renewed every five years with a new photo).
